# ðŸ“˜ My Stochastic Finance with Python Journey ðŸš€

Welcome to my personal exploration of **Stochastic Finance** through hands-on Python coding! ðŸ§ ðŸ’»

This repository is my step-by-step learning log as I go through the book **"Stochastic Finance with Python"** by Avishek Nag and explore the concepts deeply using the official codebase: [Apress/Stochastic-Finance-with-Python](https://github.com/Apress/Stochastic-Finance-with-Python).

## ðŸ§© Why I'm Doing This

I'm currently pursuing my **Masterâ€™s in Data Science** and have a growing fascination with **quantitative finance** ðŸ“ˆ, especially from a **first principles** and **mathematically intuitive** point of view.

My goal is not just to *run* the code â€” I want to **understand every formula, every line, and every financial intuition** behind it.

This repo is where I:

- Re-implement and annotate the original code,
- Break down mathematical models and their assumptions,
- Build my own visual and intuitive understanding of each concept,
- And slowly connect the dots between stochastic calculus, probability theory, and real-world finance.
